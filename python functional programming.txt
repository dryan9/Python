#Create and test a solution to solve the following problems using
# functional programming:
strs = ["elon", "mascot", "phoenix", "clemson", "has", "tiger"]
ints = [5, 17, 7, 2, 4, 15, 90]

# Problem 1: Given a list of Strings, create and print a list of strings, but
# omit any that contain an 'a'. EX) given the inputs in "strs" above, the result
# should be a list with ["Elon", "Phoenix", "Clemson", "Tiger"] - Print your result to test

def s(x):
    return "a" not in x
ss = list(filter(s,strs))
print(ss)

# Problem 2: Given a list of Strings, first append an 'i' to the end,
# then remove any strings that contain the substring 'ni'.

def append(x):
    return x + "i"
def remove(x):
    return "ni" not in x
s_append = list(map(append,strs))
s_remove = list(filter(remove,s_append))
print(s_remove) 


# Problem 3: Given a list of integers, create and print a list with all
# "teens" removed (teens are any numbers between 13 and 19)

def noTeens(x):
    return not 13<x<19
result = list(filter(noTeens, ints))
print(result)

# Problem 4: Given a list of integers, remove any with two or more digits.
# Then, sum the squares of all remaining numbers and add the product to 42.
# (In the 'ints' list provided, the correct answer should be 42+25+49+4+16 = 136
import functools

def lessTen(x):
    return x < 10
def square(x):
    return x*x
def fourtytwo(x,y):
    return x+y
ints1 = list(filter(lessTen,ints))
ints2 = list(map(square,ints1))
ints3 = functools.reduce(fourtytwo, ints2)+42
print(ints3)


# Problem 5: Given a list of Strings, create and print a list of strings by first
# removing any with lengths between 4 and 6 (inclusive), then add a "z" after the
# first letter of each remaining word.

def leng(x):
    return not 3 < len(x) < 7
def z(x):
    return x[:1] + 'z' + x[1:]
strs1 = list(filter(leng,strs))
strs2 = list(map(z,strs1))
print(strs2)


# Problem 6: Given a list of integers, create and print a list of each of the
# numbers multiplied by 3, removing any of the resulting values that end in 1.

def three(x):
    return 3*x
def one(x):
    return not 1 == x%10
timesthree = list(map(three,ints))
end = list(filter(one,timesthree))
print(end)

# Problem 7: Given a collection of integers, remove any that end in 7, then
# add together each of the remaining numbers plus an additional 2 every time
# a pair of numbers is added.
# EX: From the list above, after numbers ending in 7's are removed, the remaining
# values would be [5,2,4,15,90]. The math requested for this problem would result in:
# (5 + 2 + 2) # given that the first two values are 5 ans 2, add them plus 2
# (9 + 4 + 2) # Given 11 from the prior sum, add 4 plus 2 extra
# (15 + 15 + 2)// Given 17 from the prior sum, add 15 plus 2 extra
# (32 + 90 + 2)// Finally, add 90 plus 2 to the running sum to get the result of 124
# HINT: This is a relatively easy operation - the whole process can be accomplished with
# two function calls.

def seven(x):
    return not x%10 == 7
def additional(x,y):
    return x+y+2
int1 = list(filter(seven, ints))
ints2 = functools.reduce(additional, int1)
print(ints2)
